++ Interactivity

Interactivity is the exchange between [Users] and/or [Applications]. All interactivity is in two stages:
    * Before the interaction - IndicatePossibleInteraction
    * After the interaction - IndicatePriorInteraction

[Frontend] interactivity is implemented through:
    * speed
    * many UserInterfacing techniques
    * StateList


Interactivity is a problem in conventional RemoteSoftware due to [Network] delay and limitations.
