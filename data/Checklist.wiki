++ Checklist

Checklists StateList]s where items are limited by two states. Examples include:
    * [Compatibility] - compatible/incompatible
    * Capability - capable/incapable
    * Progress - done/incomplete

Checklists are often utilized in place of more complicated UserInterfaces such as [Portalling] since it prevents HelpLapse]s and InformationOverload. As with most StateList]s, interaction will invoke more complicated UserInterfaces to GetInto more detail.

Checklists are essential to ShowWhatTheUserWantsToKnow.
