++ Accident Safety

AS means accidents are safe. TheSystem is accident friendly. AS is implemented as:
    * SwitchSafety
    * ReversibilitySystem
    * UndoWillUndo

    Keyboard presses are regarded as more accidental as selecting with the mouse.
     * Selecting delete button on the keyboard will invoke a confirmation dialogue whereas deleting from the [UserInterfaces] will not. This is because the keyboard is easier to accidently press and either way, nothing is deleted permanently.
