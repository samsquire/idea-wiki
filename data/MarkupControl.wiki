Make File: 

 * Determine dependencies for a file.
  * Contains links to other .md files
 * Before merging a file, all parent files need to be merged. (./merged/xxx)

From the perspective of one file:
 * extract me if
 * i am more up to date than all my parents
 * i am more up to date than all my parent's merged files

Table file extraction depends on being newer than all the other Output files.
