++ Implicit Search

IS means that TheSystem is designed so that many [Frontend] [Links] are actually searches but are presented so well in the interface that they do not feel like searches.

++Implementation

IS is possible due to CrossReferential and ContextualInterfaces. [Portalling] will be used to make the design of search and query screens truly useful.
