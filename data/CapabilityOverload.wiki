++ Capability Overload

CO is when [Applications] add [Capability] that likely to be relevant but not necessary. CO increases [Complexity] and [Issues] and should be avoided.  Eventually CO results in FrenziedFeatures.

Common CO in malware scanning software includes:
    * privacy cleanup
    * startup viewers
While relevant parts of security, these should be separate implementations.

The contrary to CO is SoftwareConsolidation and SystemIntegration.
