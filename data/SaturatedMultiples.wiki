++ Saturated Multiples

SM is where multiples are saturated into one. They are useful in making multiples easier to understand and act upon. This is used because:
    * HelpTheUser
    * OnlyOnce, NoUnnecessary and NoForcedSteps

To avoid visual clutter, after dealing with an individual item, it can be:
    * removed
    * minimized from the list
    * reduced
    * automatic scroll and sort where the undecided items are always at the bottom and the list automatically scrolls to keep them in view.
Otherwise the user must constantly scroll to view undecided items.
