++ Cooperative Control

CC is a feature of MultiplayerGaming that permits multiple players to simultaneously control the same team on [Games]. This is usually only useful on real time strategy games and turn based games.

++Implementation
On map based games, the view of the map is separate and unsynchronized. The view of an ally is indicated by a border on the minimap and possibly on the game terrain. When this ally moves their view, the border moves with it. CC doesn't have to be [DesignedIn]to [Games] and can be an ImplicitImplementTheUnimplemented if [SharedImplementation]s are used.

This is useful for strategizing as different team members can focus on different parts of the map.

To avoid confusion and collisions there is a coloured marker on the unit when an orders are assigned so that allies know who has given it.

If games choose to acknowledge this feature, the members of the team could be given units that represent them, that when killed, remove control from the game. 

    * Maps generally must be large for this feature to be worthwhile.
    * Individual units can be commandable by any player of the team.
