Files are presented by the SystemViewer.
    see FileHandling

++Implementation

The different file architectures are distinct to TheSystem and SystemViewer.
    * Files that contain multiple formats, word document 
    * Compound Files are constructed of more than one file which is also has its own format. A document file may actually be a collection of multiple files
      * open document and compressed archive files

[Mapping] and AutoMapping is used to allow the user to BringCloser file-specific tasks. Relevant ContextMenu] are available. (see [Awareness])

The FileSystem determines how files and folders are stored on the HardDrive.

++Rules

    * Files are not hidden, only filterable from view
    * File size shows arrow pointing up and down if it has changed since user last saw it like video games.
