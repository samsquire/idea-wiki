++ Algorithms

Algorithms are first class citizens in TheSystem, they are available to [Developer]s because they are the fundamental building blocks of software.

++Algorithms
    * [Sorting]: quicksort, insertation sort, selection sort
    * path finding

This is a list of algorithms that I have came across and have used:

++Used but not remembered
    * A* Path finding

Quicksort
    * Selecting a central value of the list and calling it the pivot.
    * Loop from the beginning of the array from the beginning and from the end backward
    * When you find an item larger than the pivot on the left side and an item smaller than the pivot on the right, swap them around by adding them to a left list and a right list.
    * Repeat the process on the produced lists until the list is only 1 item large.
    * Concatenate the lists to create one ordered list

    * Probably easier using proper lists

++Remembered
Binary chop search
    * Select the central value of an ordered list
    * Compare the value to be searched against the central value
    * If the central value is greater than the sought value, dismiss values above the middle
    * If the central value is less than the sought value, dismiss values before the central point
    * Repeat on each remainder of the list until only the sought value remains
