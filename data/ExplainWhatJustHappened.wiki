++ Explain What Just Happened

EWJH is a feature in TheSystem that attempts to make it more clear what has just occurred in TheSystem. In ConventionalSystems it is sometimes difficult to tell what a keyboard shortcut did.

EWJH means that the keyboard shortcut would somehow be obvious what happened.

This could be implemented as an overlay that explains what just happened.

The help key, such as F1 could explain what the user has done and how they invoked something to happen. This is supported by [Logging].
