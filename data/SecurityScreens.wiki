++ Security Screens

SS are StandardizedScreens that presents the status of [Security] for the TheSystem.

    * is up to date yes/no
    * autoupdate is on/off
The PracticeSystem is used by the ExplanationSystem to present the current status as good or bad. This HelpTheUser determine where changes are necessary. For example, OFF is bad and will be rendered in red according to the practice specification. The status of each SecuritySoftware is presented in a simple and SingleInterface:
