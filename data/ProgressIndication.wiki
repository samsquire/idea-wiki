++ Progress Indication

PI is the indication of [Processing] and ongoing [Tasks].

++Implementations

There are two kinds of progress:
    * Indefinite: cannot be determined
    * Definite: progress is obvious

Definite progress can be measured by:
    * time
    * [Complexity]
    * number of [Tasks]

[Frontend] elements can indicate one or more measurements and indefinite progress:
    * ProgressBars - time/tasks
    * [Animation] - [Search]ing, [Scanning]
    * clock intersections

++Example

Connecting with a [Network] to [Download] a web page carries the following tasks:
    * create low level connection to server
    * make request to server and wait for response, indefinite time
    * receive response and size of requested document, definite size
The progress of these tasks are as follows:
    * different stages of initial protocol connection, TCP acknowledge
    * indefinite
    * definite size progress

Not all progress needs to be represented verbosely, the most important above is the indefinite type of contacting the server and content download.

++Ideas

eudora apparently has a per task progress bars
 - information popup on taskbar with individual processes progress
 - mozilla thunderbird fails if one error occurs from a queue!
mail clients need to be responsive, the paned layout makes things slower: a list of messages rarely needs to be displayed all the time
