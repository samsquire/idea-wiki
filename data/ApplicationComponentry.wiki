++ Application Componentry

Application Componentry refers to:
    * the various [ComponentStore]s of [Applications]
     * individual [Components] inside the ComponentStore

The AC:
    * any type of [Data]
    * similar or standardised
    * can apply to multiple applications or specific applications
    * components may also have the same ApplicationData [Stores]

++Exemplar Component Stores
Inside the following Component Stores exist individual components:
    * Extension/Plugin/Addon
    * [Themes]: Appearance Modifications Skins/[UserInterfaces]
    * ReviewStore
    * [Documentation]
    * PrerequisiteStore
For example, inside the Extension store will be many Extensions.

++Architecture

[Applications] tend to require some sort of [Componentry]. Rather than implementing the [Componentry] logic itself (IrrelevantCoding and CommonImplementations), the AC architecture manages components on behalf of the Application. (see [Managed])

An AC aware system allows:
    * storage for components
    * API to components
