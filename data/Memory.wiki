++ Memory

Memory is the storage of information.
     * PhysicalMemory is the medium where the information is stored.
     * LogicalMemory is what is actually stored and its structure

++ Memory Drive (aka Ramdisk, not a new concept, just a new usage)
    * networked ramdrive
     * load files/applications from hard drive to memory
     * when the memory taken by this file is needed again, free up the memory
     * online storage between computers, virtual drive
     * thought chain:
    more than enough ram -> install memory disk software -> use ram online as a temporary store
    for a server perhaps
