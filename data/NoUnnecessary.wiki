++Examples
    
    * In Window's [Chooser] if the active 'Place' is clicked, the place is refreshed, this is pointless, as soon as a place is chosen the button should unregister from input. This is accomplished through [Desensitizing]
    * Dropping the exact same file onto another is likely to cause the file to be overwritten with itself in a [Conventional] system. User should be notified of this pointless act to prevent an overwrite confirmation.<![CDATA[</div>]]>
