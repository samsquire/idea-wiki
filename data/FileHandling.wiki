++ File Handling

Handling of files is a AbstractionAwareness. 
    * The [Save]: write, delete original, rename

++Tasks
    * [Download]
    * [Caching]
    * [Open]
    * [Save]

++Offering
When a file is offered it is treated in the same way across TheSystem. This is because file transfer is one of the BaseTasks and should be a [ConsistentSystem].

    * no forced representation of a file
     * it shouldn't ask to be opened in a particular application 
    * applications shouldn't use their own dialogue to offer a file
    * physical representation of the file and the choice.
    * NoAssumptions that the user will want to download the file. They may wish to JustUse.
    * File are to be treated as files when they are offered.

++Concept Interfaces
This treats a file in the same way the SystemViewer treats them. On the left pane is icon of file and on the right are available actions.
