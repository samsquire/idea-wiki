++ Auto Interface

AI is where UserInterfaces are generated automatically. This takes into consideration:
    * positioning
    * importance
    * length of time to complete
    * ordering
    * flow
AI is used for the DataInterfacer.

Many tasks are simple stack based object manipulation: add, edit and remove. An interface can be generated for this given information regarding:
    * the format of data
    * the length of data
This is a useful wrapper for simple command line programs such as HTPASSWD where users are added, modified and deleted. This could even be part of an architecture where simple rules are written:
    * obtain stack
    * add to stack - append to file, substitution of (NAME:PASSWORD), or format file
    * remove from stack
    * edit stack

    * generate cluttered interface on system commands using rules of frequency and important to determine what comes first
