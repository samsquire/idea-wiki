++ Native Networks

NN are the DesignedIn NativeImplementation]s for connecting TheSystem to other TheSystem]s. The NN is a SelectiveImplementation:
    * File transfer
    * InterfaceSharing
    * NetworkAdministration, NetworkMonitoring (co-operative)
    * DistributedProcessing

[Conventional] running of RemoteSoftware is inefficient since it [Download]s the entire application. Running [Remote] [Applications] on NN needs an IntelligentImplementation that only transmit what is necessary.
    * executable archives on Windows containing multiple languages and different hardware
large application file running remotely will run-relevantly so that no unnecessary transfer occurs
