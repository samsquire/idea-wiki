++ Linux

what is right/wrong with linux
- amarok is very powerful but overcomplicated and confusing
- links do not exist where they should - the left side places bar which shows common places can be customised, edited/added
- silly errors - 'nothing on clipboard'
- help documentation had error messages in it
- stupid dialogues would ask to save even if nothing had changed
- linux is so slow
