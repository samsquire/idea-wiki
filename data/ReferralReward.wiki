++ Referral Reward

RR is the reward received by someone who referred another to a service or otherwise.

++Implementation

[Conventional] referral implementations on WebServer]s use a unique identifier in the [Paths] that refers to the user which recommended. The problem with this is that this is quickly lost if the recipient navigates away from that particular page.

An idea from a Simple Machines Forum mod was to set a cookie that stored the referrer ID so that it stays for a duration. This way the referrer can receive credit accurately.

An improvement to the idea is to obfuscate the user identifier and uniquely identify all [Paths]. This means that no matter what [Paths] are used, they can receive credit. The problem with this is the unnecessary credit given from large websites.

A sideeffect of this method is that links can be traced to who gave them out. Although this could not be relied upon due to abuse.

Other steps include:
    * awarding credit if the new member settles into the community well, such as by following rules well. This would promote CommunityQuality.
    * awarding only certain parts of the website, such as the homepage.
