++ File Grouping

FG is a feature for [FileSystem]s that allows [Files] to be grouped arbitrarily or based on rules.
    * FG is used extensively by the SystemViewer and ObjectInterfacer

++Reasoning

Grouping files into units makes file identification and [Autonomy] easier. Use cases include:
     * an [Applications] files are grouped together, the group is classed as a unit
     * a user wishes to loosely associate some files together without physically separating them
     * similar files grouped together based on file type, the name of the application and play button will open the application

[Batching] can be applied to groups. the file group for 'application' would open application management.

++Implementation

File groupings can be created by explicit assignment or implicit predefined rules.
