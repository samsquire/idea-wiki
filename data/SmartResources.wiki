++ Smart Resources

SR is the usage of [Resources] efficiently. This can be accomplished through:
    * scheduling
    * parallel processing - [Concurrency]
    * [Ordering]
    * [Prioritizing]

[Awareness] of [Processing] types is a strategy to utilize resources optimally. If TheSystem knows that one application is memory bound while another is CPU bound, they can run concurrently without issue.
