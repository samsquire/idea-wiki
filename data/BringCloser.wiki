++ Bring Closer

This is where [UserInterfaces] are brought closer from a HigherLevel or StandardMultiples into one.

    * The modification and display of data is on the same interface. No Edit buttons.
    * Merging intermittent displays together.

ContentClassification uses this so that an irrelevant web browser does not have to be opened for a web page after using dedicated interfaces. Otherwise it would not be a ConsistentSystem.
