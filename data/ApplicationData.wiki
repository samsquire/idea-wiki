++ Application Database

SystemInformation is stored per-application and records facts about software. The database is created when an application is installed or used on a system.

++Involved Data

AD tends to hold low level data about an application. Most of the information is collected from an appropriate SoftwareServer. [RelevancyHook]s are installed to ensure that information is not needlessly stored.

    * versioning scheme - how the version numbers work
     * versions - list of versions
      * changelog - what has changed since each and every version both logically(behaviour) and physically(files, formats etc) needs a interface!
    * [Issues] IssueSystem
     * bugs
     * errors
     * mistakes
    * events/handlers
     * error handling information
      * send the error information to a central server for example
    * log format reference/structure 
    * [Configuration] descriptor/format reference

This database is not entirely developer specific. SystemInformation from the database is used to inform the user, eg, the SolutionSystem.

    * can be shipped with the application itself
    * downloaded from a SoftwareServer
    * created from scratch, see [Developer]
