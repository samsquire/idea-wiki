++ Derived Store

A derived store is based on another and shares parts of it. Stores are derived by:
    * renaming
    * inheriting

++Why?
Stores are derived because:
     * Consistency between [Applications] is important
     * [ApplicationCategories] of [Applications] will use different names for the same [Stores].
     * Behaviours can be slightly different and it makes more sense to derive than to remake.
