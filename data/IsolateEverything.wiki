++ Isolate Everything

IE means that all [Applications] are completely isolated from one another for [Security]. This is possible through:
    * GrainedControl
    * GrainedSeparation

++Examples
    * Every program runs in the context of its own user. Any attempt to do something dangerous or strange will cause an alert.
