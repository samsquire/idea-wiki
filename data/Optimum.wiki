++ Optimum

Optinum means to be efficient and UseBest.

++Software

    * when the computer is not doing anything, there should be very few reads or writes
    * detect best scheduling method based on system performance
    * easy to see/meter/limit IO, CPU and network users
    * modification to modules without harming - the linux scheduler obviously needs to be completely modular but also intricately modular, i need to change the way and the policy of an implementation WITHOUT unwieldy configuration files

    * installers and software listings indicate what is optimum for a computer
    * 32-bit and 64-bit
    
    * if a version of the software exists for the processor version, then advise user in getting it, otherwise wait until it is released
