++ Empty Abstraction

An empty abstraction is one that is not used to its full potential because:
    * little to no applications use it
    * not enough information is available to use or understand it.
    * 

InformationUnavailibility and DatalessTemplates are signs of an EA and LowStandards tends to be the cause.

++Examples
    * In Windows XP services configurations are an empty abstraction.
    
    * ELF executable headers, ignored by Linux
