++ Macs Are Bad Computers

I am a Linux and Windows user by trade. When I got a Mac Book Pro from work I was severely disappointed:

    * Heats up very quickly. Little ventilation from a slot that gets obfuscated when the lid is wide open. Uncomfortable to type on or put on lap.
    * Speakers are tiny sounding. A Toshiba from 2008 sounds better than this MacBook Pro from late 2012.
    * Package management non-existent.
    * Lion is a horrible user interface.
    * Keyboard usability is severely lacking. You have to turn on keyboard shortcuts and even then they don't work properly. Keyboard use on a Linux or Windows machine just works.
    * Default shortcuts are nonsensical - they interfere with many applications such as IntelliJ.
    * Finder is unuseable.
