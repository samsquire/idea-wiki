++ Decentralized Social Network

The DSN is a new architecture for social applications. These are some features of the DSN:

    * *Decentralized*: Unlike traditional social networks which are controlled and accessed at one location the DSN can be ran how you like: on your PC, on your server or on the move.
    * *Distributed*: The workload of the network is distributed between all nodes.
    * *Simple*: The protocol should be simple to understand, to implement. The data model should be easy to explain in a minute.
Concepts:
    * Personal Data Ecosystem - you control the data, you decide when it is disclosed
    * Vendor Relationship Management
    * Social networking
    * Group purchasing

++Standard

The social network is composed from a basic model:
    * *Identity*: An identity is a person or organization running the software.
    * *Packets*: Packets carry data between members of the network. They are the enevelopes that hold .
    * *Announcements*: Announcements inform *Peers* that something is available.
    * *Outpackets*: Outpackets are outgoing packets that communicate with other *Identities*, examples include: *Status Update*, *Comment*s, *Announcements*
    * *Inpackets*: These are the packets received by other *Identities*.
    * *Account*: An account is your entry to the network. Your account is protected by username and password. This is how you use your *Identity*.
    * *Provider*:

++Approach

We need vendors to adopt the PDS and VRM functionality as part of the ecommerce middleware that they use.

++Drivers

Drivers are used to transmit packets between users. The bare mimimum they must offer is the ability to transmit and receive files.

Most drivers have two counterparts: one for sending data to remote users and one for receiving files from remote users.

Send drivers are configured from:
    * the user's ACCOUNT
    * the recipient's PROFILE
Receive drivers are configured only from the user's ACCOUNT, as this contains important server information and credentials.

+++Available Drivers
    * SMTP Driver
    * IMAP Driver
    * HTTP POST Driver

++User search

How do users find one another?

++Development
    * Setup local mailserver
    * Create a local DNS server
    * Create test domain and email accounts
    * Write transfer drivers to interact by email
