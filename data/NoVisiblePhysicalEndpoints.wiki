++ No Visible Physical Endpoints

NVPEP means that [Users] rarely view a PhysicalEndpoint unless requested. NVPEP is a HelpTheUser and a ShowWhatTheUserWantsToKnow. NVPEP applies especially to:
    * [Database]s
    * [Configuration]
    * [Protocols]
    * SystemViewer - the files are not displayed in the order as they are on the medium

NVPEP is implemented through PhysicalRepresenting.
