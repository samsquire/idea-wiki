++ Low Priority Empty Folders

Folders with no files inside them are arguably of lesser importance in TheSystem.

The SystemViewer should aim to take advantage of this fact by:
    * ensuring they are not mistaken for folders with files inside
    * grouping them together
    * making them easy to find when saving as it is likely during a save one will want to categorise something
    * do not change the view of files and folders too extensivwel between viewing and saving extensively otherwise users may be unable to find folders
