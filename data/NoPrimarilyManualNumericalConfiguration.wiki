Numerical [Performance] controls should never be manual. Examples include:
    * threads
    * maximum connections
    * [Caching] sizes
    * Scanning/Update frequency
    * [Polling]

Instead HelpTheUser and AutomaticSetup and intelligence is used to ensure [Performance] is set to a realistic value.
