++Delayed Calculation/Lazy Programming
    * ways of implementing:
     * smart calculation caching rather than specifying
     * joint-values that update when the constituents of the derivative change
     * template, having to embed equations with variables without having them evaluate, evaluate on call
     * compound code, code/equations made up of different peices


programming too reliant on order of data
