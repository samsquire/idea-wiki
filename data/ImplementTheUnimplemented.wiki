++ Implement The Unimplemented

This is where there is sufficient [Technologies] available on a system to create a NativeImplementation of [Unimplemented] features on a system. There are two types of ITU:    
    * Explicit ITU - where [Developer]s create the functionality
    * ImplicitImplementTheUnimplemented
IITU is the preferred ITU.

++How
This is accomplished through the following:

    * [Mapping] - ftp search
    * ShareArchitecture
    * [Uplevelling]
    * DeepCustomisation
    * [Externalisation]
    * [Componentry]
