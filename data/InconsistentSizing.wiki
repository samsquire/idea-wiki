++ Inconsistent Sizing

IS means that InterfacePanels and [Frontend]s can support odd sizing.

In [Conventional] sytems, like [Windows], list items can only take consistent sizes.

++Examples
In this [Frontend], there are two columns but the column on the right orientates itself in the middle of the left columns for cleanliness.
