++ Dataless Templates

Dataless Templates are where software uses a neat template to present data, but not all data is availble and appears empty.

    * DT is a side affect from [Directness] - where information is simply not available and assumptions have been made that the data will always exist
    * OverAbstraction - multiple layers of data passing

++Problems
    * DT is pointless and frustrating to users
    * reduces [Purity]

++Examples
    [Authoring]
     The authoring information may not always be available, so rather than showing a DT - "no information could be found", HelpTheUser and make a CrossReferential to a SoftwareServer portal that lists any software that will be able to detect authoring, instead check whether any software is available, if yes - display "no information could be found, you may need to expand to detect authoring"
    
    * log files - where not all information has been logged and there are lot of empty fields
    * help files - sections exist but contain nothing

++Solutions
    * hide empty fields or dataless files
    * make it impossible to open if there is little data
