++ Representation Chooser

The RC allows CasualModification that permits [Users] to select which representation the RepresentationSystem should use.

++Implementation

VisibleData is displayed in a particular representation. [Users] can change the representation by interacting with the data. To invoke the RC a button is pressed. This is likely to be a right mouse click or the middle click. A list of possible representations is displayed and the user can make a choice.

The size field can be represented in many ways:
    * in a particular unit: bits, bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes
    * relative to a size, a hard drive, floppy disk
    * against a scale
    * DataMapping

The date field can be represented as:
    * RealRepresentation: a calendar strip (in RelativeReference)
    * English RelativeReference and FriendlyData

Rules would be configured to use a particular representation depending on the data itself.
    * Kilobytes/Megabytes/Gigabytes should be used if there is under 1024
    * Relative references are within one week: 29/05/07 and Last Tuesday (the date now is: 4/6/07

InterfaceRouting enables the RC to route representations to different areas. For example, if bytes are displayed in the true field, the bits are routed to its ToolTips for IndepthData.
