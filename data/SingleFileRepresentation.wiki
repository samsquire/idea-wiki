++ Single File Representation

SFR is a form of MultipleRepresentationsOfFiles where the TheSystem's stores one PhysicalEndpoint and represents only one LogicalEndpoint on the [Frontend]. Upon request, AutomaticConversion is used to produce the file in desired [Representations].
    * SFR differs to SynchronizedFileRepresentations in that there is only ever a single PhysicalEndpoint.
    * SFR is very similar to RepresentationGrouping although it refers to content rather than formats.

++Examples

[Applications] are often written to require particular format as input. If the PhysicalEndpoint of a representation is not in this format, it cannot be used without RepresentationConversion. The SystemViewer shows this file as a single element. Upon selection, TheSystem will use DirectConversion to make the file the correct format.
