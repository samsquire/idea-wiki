++ Context Search

CS is a type of ImplicitSearch whereby the information displayed to the user is displayed in context with the user. For example, clicking a date field will show information collected at various dates close to the selected date.

++Examples

    * clicking the 'Size' field of an email may show files of similar size, the same size or show the history of that file's size over time. There needs to be a clever way to program default data compilations explicitly.
