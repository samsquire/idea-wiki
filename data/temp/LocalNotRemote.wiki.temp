++ Local Not Remote

LNR means that [Applications] should be predominantly local. This is encouraged by DesktopFirst.

++Implementation

[Users] on [Conventional] systems are increasingly delegating control of UsersContent to [Remote] sources. Reasons for this include:
    * poor DesktopApplications
    * complicated
    * worldwide access
    * better features available online

LNR aims to avoid this by:
    * NoBaseTaskDownload
    * UserCentralisation
    * SelfHosting
