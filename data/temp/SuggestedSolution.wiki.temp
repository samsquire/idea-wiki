++ Suggested Solution

SS is when the SolutionSystem deduces a solution from [Errors] and [Issues]. This is needed because of TryBeforeChecking.

If the problem is clicked, [Portalling] is used to display [Help]. SS also uses CommercialIntegration and CollaborativeData to help [Users] solve problems. This includes:
    * CommercialIntegration, [ReviewStore] for products that would solve the problem
    * Communication with [Users] also with the problem.


++Examples
    * A file cannot be written because it is readonly.
    * The user has permission to change the access privileges.
    * Offer to change permissions

    
    * use LogTunnel to determine why
perhaps it means the last interaction which could have caused it is found
    * todo: find out what log tunnels are
