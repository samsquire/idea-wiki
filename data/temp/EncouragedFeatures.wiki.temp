++ Encouraged Features

EF is a method of trying to increase the number of people who use a feature by increasing their awareness of it. [Conventional]ly this seems to be accomplished by autostarting the application or showing a random tip explaining how to use a feature.  This is pretty ineffective because the user is inundated with pointless or too much information.

EF is a way of encouraging [Users] to do things with their computers they would not normally. This feature is provided thanks to the implementation of the [TaskArchitecture]. A subset of random tasks from random categories is selected and displayed with an enticing description. Following are a series of examples:

 Technical: Stream media to game console
Connect this computer to the internet
Use your cellphone to connect to the internet

++EF
EF will evaluate the users' current computer status before suggesting things to do with the computer. For example, suggesting that the user boost their wireless signal is silly if they are using a wired connection.
    * Each suggested feature or task will be attached prerequisites for the task. Some will include software, hardware purchases or additional installations whereas others different things. The user can therefore sort through the things that are cheapest, take the least time or highly community rated.
