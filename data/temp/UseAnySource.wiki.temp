++ Use Any Source

This means that any [Source] should be usable in [Applications] or by TheSystem. JustUse is an implementation that promotes UAS.

UAS means the promotion of data usage from any source:
    * data from the [Network] or [Internet]
    * VisibleData, DynamicData and InteractiveText

UAS creates NoForcedSteps if [Users] want to use a source without [Save].

++Implementation
UserInterfaces create AbstractionAwareness by ensuring that the [Users] understand the source has yet to be [Save]d.
    * The save button may be larger than usual.
    * Differentiate the interface to avoid accidents when the user believes it is saved. AccidentSafety, IndicateSource

[Frontend]s contain data which can be manually [Import]ed into other [Applications]. Common UserInterfacing concepts are likely to allow the dragging and dropping of a frontend into another. SpecificTarget and [Directness] promotes this because they allow the specific transfer of large amounts of information. Conventional systems require the data has to be stored in the form of [Files].

Processes hold data in LogicalMemory which can be utilized elsewhere. ApplicationIndependentState is the best example of this.

The connections possible due to the DataInterfacer].

UAS means that implementations can be used in ways they were not originally designed. As any source can be used, this includes [Protocols].

++Examples

    * The FTP protocol is designed to transfer files. It utilizes both a command stream and a data stream. At the end of the day, the file is an abstraction, the FTP protocol can be used as a 

use FTP as a command protocol, doesn't always have to store as file
 - use streams live


* applications, processes, threads, windows, interface elements inputs since they are abstracted

    * an entity that might take a few minutes to download will show a download dialogue for example

    * need a way to say 'i want this'
    * applications will open documents of information that is not saved
    * the save button should be larger
