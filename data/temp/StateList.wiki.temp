SL enables [Users] and [Applications] to review states of individual items. SL are stored in MachineReadable format and are rendered in InformationInterface as SmartItem]s. 

Common lists containing states are likely to include:

    * completion/progress - ProgressiveFeedback
     * finished, IndicatePriorInteraction
     * unfinished
    * abilities, capability - CapabilityStore
    * [Compatibility] - CompatibilityStore
    * [History] PL are possible due to UserTracking.

InterfacePanels are used to portray the individual item's state. This is frequently sourced from its [Portalling] and displayed in ListStyle.

    Checklists aid [Navigation] and HelpTheUser prevent HelpLapse]s on what they need to do next.
