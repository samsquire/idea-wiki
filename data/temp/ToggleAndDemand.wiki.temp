++ Toggle And Demand

TAD is where options are available and either can be set as the default. To invoke a different option on demand, the user presses a keyboard button or a different mouse button.

++Examples
    * Middle click mouse
    * 'open in new window' on a list of items when holding shift will open in separate windows, nonshift opens them in same tab - because it makes sense
