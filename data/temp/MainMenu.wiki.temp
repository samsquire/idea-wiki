++ Main Menu

The MM is on the taskbar and holds:
    * installed applications
    * BaseTasks

Single instance [Open] [Applications] do not need to appear in the MM if they are already open since they are already on the taskbar.

Conventional MM are [Files] on the FileSystem. PhysicalEndpoint]s are BrittleData since they have poor PointConsistency. This often results in broken [Links] and create visual clutter. TheSystem uses LogicalEndpoint with special [Representations] so that broken links are impossible. NoBrittleData

It is likely the MM is a normal menu with heavy [Configuration] due to ConfigureNotReimplement. As a result, normal menu APIs are used to change it.
start menu is a logical endpoint, an API - NOT a filesystem

TotalReversibility means that all entries created in the MM are removed.

 - filesystems are impossible to manage efficiently this means
 - no scanning for known and safe applications etc
