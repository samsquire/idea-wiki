++ Smart Difference

SD is an implementation of OnlyStoreDifferences. The efficiency of OSD deteriorates after many changes are made. 

SD prevents this from happening by restarting the stage where differences are calculated from. This is called a "checkpoint". This will be made when applying changes require more resources than acceptable: space, memory or CPU.

delta encoding detect changes then if the changes get too much to patch into memory on render a complete new copy is made
