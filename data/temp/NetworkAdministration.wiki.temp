++ Network Administration

NA is a NoBaseTaskDownload where [Network]s can be administrated without further software.

++Implementation

If sufficient rights over nodes is available, [Frontend]s and [Backend]s can be controlled through InterfaceSharing. This is essentially remote desktop.

With the NativeNetworks and cooperative NetworkMonitoring, useful information can be pooled including:
    * [Resources]
    * [Performance]
    * [Processing]
    * [Issues]
    * [Reports]
    * [Metering]
    * ApplicationManagement
    * [Configuration]
    * DefenceArchitecture

This provides the following features:
    * ResourceControl means that nodes can be instructed to utilize a enforce a maximum bandwidth. This is likely to be presented by sliders widgets for each node widgets that control proportions of traffic of the maximum bandwidth.

    * [Update]s can be applied remotely because nodes report version information.

traffic limiting/shaping across a LAN
 - view versions on all nodes, selecting them all and updating is lame

Many Servers - concept NOT a microkernel, instead high level applications are lots of servers: frontends, backends, distinct interchangeable implementations

++Interfaces

[Network]s are a combination of many different [Entity]s and physical [Hardware]:
    * individual nodes
    * cabling
    * network [Hardware]
These elements must be CrossReferential to relevant SystemComponents, data from NetworkMonitoring and to [Encyclopedia]s (NoMixGeneralSpecificInformation)
    * NetworkMonitoring
    * NetworkCacher
    * [Outsourcing]
    * NetworkDeployment

++Features
    * Remote Administration
    * ApplicationManagement / UpdateArchitecture / [Backup]
    * List of nodes
    * SystemComparison
    * NetworkMonitoring
