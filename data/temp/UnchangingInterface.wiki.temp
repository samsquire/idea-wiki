++ Unchanging Interface

UI are UserInterfaces that do not switch between stages, unlike StagedInterfaces. UI are important where obtaining is the purpose of the interface.

The simplest UI is where a list of [Links] state 'Get' and when clicked, the list item stays where it is and turns into a progress bar. The interface doesn't switch to another.
