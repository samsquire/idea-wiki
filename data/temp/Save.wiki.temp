This is so that when the file is [Open]ed, the original application that created it used to open it in the future. This is an AbstractionAwareness that prevents HelpLapse]s when the default is not the same as the application that created it.

AutomaticStandardEstablishment is a feature configured by TheSystem or through UserRule in [Configuration].
