++ Merged Display

A merged display is where multiple types of displays are combined, automatically.
    * MD differs to MergedMultipleDisplay since it only merges similar objects into the same interface.

++Implementation

A MD is possible due to [PanelGrid]s. Each cell in the grid can store a certain type of display format.
