++ Remote Software

RS is a platform which makes it possible for currently uninstalled and remote [Applications] to run.
    * RS aims to solve the problems of web applications.
    * Fix the weaknesses of XUL and AJAX.
The user can choose [Installation] of RS so it may be run without [Download].

++Implementation

RS can utilize rich desktop-bound UserInterfaces that are typically only available to DesktopApplications. This includes features like:
    * persistent menus: when menus stay at the top
    * SingleInterface
    * UnchangingInterface
The presentation logic is completely separate from the software logic. This means RS can operate with and without connectivity.
    * Only necessary information is transmitted to the server.
    * During offline usage, the state is continued until connectivity returns 

persistent parts of a web page..frames are efficient but need to be MORE embedded

++Balance

RS is a balance between:
    * [Security]
    * Ease of use
    * Large applications
    * NoUnnecessary [Installation]

++Requirements
    * no security vulnerabilities
    * non-imposing security limitations
    * extendable
    * modular
    * fast
    * small
    * offline/online interaction with server
    * powerful


* users do not like to download applications
 * activeX style but less authority?
 * previous idea: open applications before install
  * no difference between installed applications and open applications?
* only when data is saved is the application actually installed
 * application can only modify it's saved space - not files?
