++ Chat

Chat [Applications] allow [Users] to communicate to eachother, even across [Network]s.

++Automatic Status
    * If the user signals states they are going away, eg, by typing an acronym such as 'brb'. The status should automatically be modified as such.
    * When the player returns and starts typing again, the status should return back to normal. Perhaps it should only return to normal when the user has pressed enter - to avoid accidental status reverts.
    * Multiple messages can be reordered manually so that they make more sense.
