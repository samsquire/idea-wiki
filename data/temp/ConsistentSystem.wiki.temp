++ Consistent System

TheSystem should be as consistent as possible. Consistency is achived by:

    * DownlevelToTheSystem
    * [Standards]
    * StandardMultiples
    * StandardEstablishment

Consistency should never be accomplished through IrrelevantCoding, instead it is accomplished through [Centralisation].
