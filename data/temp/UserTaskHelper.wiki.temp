++ User Task Helper

The UTH detects the intentions of [Users] and uses IssueDetection to see if there could be a problem.

++Email 
[Users] add attachments to [Email]s to deliver [Files] to contacts. If the attachment is too large, the recipient may not be able to receive it. UTH would fire when the user adds the file after attaching a large file.
    * The email client states that it is unlikely it will be deliverable since it is too large
    * it would then use the Alternative Manager to offer alternative transfer mechanisms that are UseBest and MoreEfficient
 * check infrastructure/policy file of email host to see if capable of receiving such large file
  * integration to internal policies, eg, request large file transfer to mail administrator as a warning
