++ Timed Disclosure

TD is a DisclosureSystem feature which allows information to disclosed:
    * for a certain duration
    * at a particular time
    * a mixture of both

This can be used to enforce [Security] and [Permissions] on UsersContent. TD is especially useful for controlling its sharing with [Sharer].

TD can be used to:
    * hide additional information
    * detect inconsistencies

++Implementation

    * For local content, TheSystem's own time implementation can be used
    * For [Remote] content, the data must be encrypted and unlocked with a key.

++Uses
    * [Forum]
    * [Email]
    * [Chat]
