++ Self Hosting

SH is a proposal that encourages LocalNotRemote by enabling [Users] to host UsersContent on the machine.

++Implementation

SH requires high [Security] so that TheSystem isn't compromised. Usually users will want to limit access to authorized people. SH is likely to have integration with [CommunicationSoftware] and PermissionManager to allow access to be controlled. Often the user may wish control to be completely private and inaccessible to the outside world.

++Examples
    * WebServer
    * [Servers]
    * Email Server
