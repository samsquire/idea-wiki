(( need a page about 'easy to use'/use friendliness

Apache, a [Conventional] server will accept a request and continue receiving packets regardless of the extensive length of a HTTP command. NativeImplementation]s would drop the connection before it can be completed. ImpossibilityDetection can be used as a premeptive [Security] measure by dropping requests that are clearly impossible or invalid.

For example, the maximum command can be calculated by using the folder hierarchy. Providing the file doesn't use query strings or accept form data, it is dropped immediately.

++Requirements

    * The server has complete control over the structure of a website. For this reason, AnyMapping is available so that all visible content is structured virtually. This means files, folders can be named arbitarily.
