++ Shared Implementation

Shared Implementation are modules that are [Share]d via [Externalisation] by the ShareArchitecture.

SI are stored in LogicalMemory for [Performance]. Applications may require different MultipleVersions of SI. Loading multiple versions harms performance and creates OverIsolation redundancy and against OnlyOnce. Preventative solutions UseBest:
    * the requirements of software that are already loaded are chosen over those that aren't
    * the [Sorting], [Ordering] presents the best choices first.

If a better solution is not available, [SmartCache]s mean loading multiple versions is done efficiently and not wastefully.

Physically, SI are stored in StandardEstablishment]s.
