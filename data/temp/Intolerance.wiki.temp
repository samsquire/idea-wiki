++ Intolerance

* intolerance is where the system doesn't tolerate invalid or inconsistent communications with other machines and will not understand them

++Advantages
* higher speed

++Disadvantages
* incompatibility

++Examples

* HTTP: only tolerate CRLF and never LF
 * never check for only LF 

++Features

Not tolerating machines will be confusing to both clients and servers. This is why the information can be processed at a later time. 
see NeverFailWithoutWhy

Statistics can be used to determine whether the intolerant server is worth the disadvantages.

+++Later Log Processing
Process information later to determine why the client/server was rejected/rejected. This means there is no extra error logic at the time of the failed request, the request is simply written and later processed.
At the time of the failure:
* do not attempt to figure out why it failed when the request happened

Later processing:

* use data availble at the time:
    * HTTP: user agent
    * protocol+protocol designer: structure/validity
* create statistics
 * heuristics
