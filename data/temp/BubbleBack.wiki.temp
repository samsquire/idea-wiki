++ Bubble Back

Bubble back is a highlight behind objects. The highlight can indicate:
    * status (FileState)
    * groupings ([FileGrouping]s)
    * type
If groupings overlap, there should be a clear Venn diagram effect that is visible and understandable.

++Implementation

An intelligent placement algorithm will be needed during the rendition stages of the targets of BubbleBack. This will ensure that everything can have BB applied. This algorithm should support:
    * diagonal groupings
    * maximise all the backing of preconditions, avoid leaving orphan backings


++Requirements
    * Multiple rows and columns, a grid, like a PanelGrid
