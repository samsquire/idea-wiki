++Ideas

a database architecture that uses the common information types as its column types
 there is a master class for telephone numbers, email addresses, people can can add their own formats to the master class but there will only be one single master class, each subclass says what things it supports and what it doesn't, this is to prevent people being forced to write custom data type routines like in microsoft access validation and input masks
