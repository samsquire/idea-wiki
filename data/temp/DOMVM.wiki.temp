++ DOMVM

The DOMVM is a virtual machine optimized for constructing a dynamic view of the DOM but also emitting strings.

 * This is accomplished by having a tree kept in memory while the server is running for the site.

 * Unlike a normal DOM tree, this dense DOM tree only stores the nodes that can potentially change due to user or database activitiy. This way the DOM can be cached easily.
