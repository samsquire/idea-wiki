++ Downlevel To The System

[BaseTasks] and other features are downlevelled to TheSystem's domain to create consistency and robust [Architecture]. This is a StandardEstablishment. The downlevelling means that the following resources are shared:

    * [UserInterfaces] - dialogues
    * [ComponentStore]s
    * [EntityStore]s
    * [Bases]
The shared resources are not restricted by TheSystem. 
    * DownlevelledSystems describes particular downlevelled systems.

++Examples
    * [Applications] and SystemComponents use the same [UserInterfaces] which make the system easier to learn. see StandardizedScreens
