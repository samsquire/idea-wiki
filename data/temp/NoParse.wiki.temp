++ No Parse

NP is one of the [Paradigms] that states that parsing should be avoided. Parsing is a LogicalEndpoint and reduces [Performance] but has the advantage of being dynamic and easy to modify.

Parsing is where NoEnumeration applies and should be replaced with ContinuousInitialization if possible. Parsing promotes lump, all at once processing. ParseCompile is a parse in combination with [Initialization] it reduces the speed impact but retains the flexibility of parsing.

NP is especially important in the ComputerStages.

* shouldn't parse text on startup - should be like reading a book, instructions (executing) or enumerating a list
a solution:
 * precompile text config files/parse once
  * linked config file and database:
   * when database is modified, the appropriate config files are
   * when config files modified, the database is updated
 * database is used in the future as opposed to text files - text files are for user friendliness
