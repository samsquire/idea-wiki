++ Minimum Information

There is a minimum amount of information to be stored about everything. This is to protect TheSystem from:
    * DatalessTemplates
    * EmptyAbstraction
    * InformationUnavailibility

As an advantage, MI means that:
    * AlwaysFeedback to [Feedback] is easier

This is an example of a HighMinimum.
