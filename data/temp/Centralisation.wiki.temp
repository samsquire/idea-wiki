++ Centralisation

Centralisation is where something is accessible at a central location. This is important for multiple subsystems:
    * [Bases]
    * UserCentralisation

UserInterfaces wise, centralisation means that [Portalling] is accessible from one area, such as the SystemConfigurationScreen.
