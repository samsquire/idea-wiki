++ Single Interface

SI is where UserInterfaces only present one window and do not spawn additional windows. SI is core to [InformationInterface]s and [PagedInterface]s. SI would be a ToggleAndDemand customisable feature:
    * SI on or off by default
    * middle click to force open in current window or as new window

Conventional [Applications] have child dialogues open from a parent. SI is used instead so for [Directness] and BringCloser. Data should be modifiable from where it is. This is CasualModification and an example of UnchangingInterface. It also reduces extra IrrelevantCoding.
