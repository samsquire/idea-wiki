++ Placeholders Rather Than Links

PRTL means that [Placeholders] should be preferred in place of [Links].

++Architecture

Content displays a StandardRepresentations or CommonInformation that when clicked will cause activation and opening.

The best example of PRTL is in [Email]. [Users] can receive [Email]s containing [Links] to various different content: pictures, videos and audio. Rather than forcing the user to click on the attachment or click the link, an embedded placeholder representing the link's content could be displayed.
