++ Accountable System

AS means that actions, components and concepts of TheSystem have [Accountability].

++Implementation

Important interactions of TheSystem include:
    * [Bases]
    * writing to files
    * threads, processes
    * [Network] activity

[Conventional] systems require specialist tools to view the technicalities of how [Applications] are currently interacting with TheSystem. This is bad because:
    * unfriendly to users
    * there is no accountability for what is happening
    * differentiates well and poorly developed [Applications]. For example, Windows has way many hidden windows that have no obvious purpose

Accountability is therefore a OrganizeFromTheBeginning. Internal structures are well documented, clean and tidy. The following rules aim to encourage AS:
    * OfficiallyAcceptedCertification is only awarded to applications that have full accountability
    * ApplicationsMustExplainThemselves
    * promotingusage of SharedImplementation rather than [Reimplementation]

++Examples
    * Disk activity is rarely possible to account on conventional applications, it requires manual supervision of applications.
