++ Game Interfaces Are Good

GIAG is an observation that many UserInterfaces in [Games] are:
    * well designed
    * easy to use
    * fast
    * easy to learn
    * colourful
    * fun

This trend can be used to help design interfaces in TheSystem so that:
    * information is quickly communicated
    * ObviousInterface
    * pretty

game designers often make brilliant user interfaces: they are functional, pretty and simple
 - TheSystem interfaces should be designed as if it was a game
