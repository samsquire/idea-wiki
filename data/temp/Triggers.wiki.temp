++ Triggers

Triggers are events or states of TheSystem, [Applications] and other architectures. DirectedLogic is placed into triggers which are invoked when the trigger is reached.

[UserNotifications] is the [Users] representation of triggers.

++Architecture

[Applications] use [Externalisation] to expose the [Triggers] they offer. TheSystem or [Users] may place DirectedLogic into triggers so that when triggered, the directed logic fires. Triggers can be conditional.

Triggers can be divided into active and passive.
    Active triggers are processed everytime the trigger is invoked.
     * [Passthrough]
     * [Hooking]
    Passive triggers are only processed if the trigger is invoked:
     * [Watch]

[Portalling] is used to represent [Triggers] and [Desensitizing] is administered in this fashion.
