++ Interactive Text

IT is where text has associated interactions with them. The text's structure has meaning in the RepresentationSystem. This is parsed as soon as possible per DataMapping.

++Incremental Meaning
Strings with incremental meaning such as [Paths] can be invoked in entirety or specific by its specific components. For example, the path of: ftp://sam/images/holiday has the following components:
     * protocol specifier: FTP, would open the user's FTP client
     * sam folder
     * sam/images folder
     * sam/images/holiday folder
Even if only the protocol specifier was selected, the entire text object should be given so that it can be accessed manually from within the client.

    * HTML can be modified on the fly. Use spacebar as the "/".
