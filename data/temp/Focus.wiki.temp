[Configuration]
Configuration panels for example are large and hold a lot of information. To make a user complete them by opening a configuration panel is not the right thing to do if the user only needs to change something trivial.

Instead, the relevant information is 'focused' by either
     * configuration panel is opened and the input where information is required is higlighted
     * simple wizard-like panel containing an input for the information
      * with a button to open the full panel 

Overlarge Fields
     * 'zoom in', a field that isn't large enough to accomoodate all the data can be opened in a larger new dialogue so everything can be viewed
     * in the native text editor?
     * what about on save?
