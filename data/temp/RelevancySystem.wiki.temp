++ Relevancy System

The RS ensures something is relevant to the system. This is accomplished via a RelevancyHook. The RS is important for:
    * [History]
    * [Cacher]
    * Dependencies
    * [Multiples]

When the relevancy system has decided something is not in use it can either be deleted or placed into a SmartCache.
