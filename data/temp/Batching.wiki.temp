++ Batching

Batching is where many can be treated as a singular.
    * is a BaseInteraction
    * Batching enables an action to apply to multiple items without selecting them individually manually. NoManual
    * The batch may or not be a [Queue] of actions to take place against each item.
    * OrderPreservation may apply for a batch.


++Implementation
    * [Targeter] to select all items
    * Checkboxes represent the selection of an item. The action is then applied to all selected items.

++Problems

Some systems use batching as the primary technique of issuing commands to [Multiples]. If the user wants to select a single item rather than multiple items the user has to interact more than necessary and is forced through more steps. (NoUnnecessary and NoForcedSteps)
