++ Practice System

The PS HelpTheUser to choose the best practice. This can be settings or actions from the user. The practice system works like this:
    * Scans [Configuration] / notices something against good practice
    * Explain and tell user what is wrong
    * Offers to fix it or give intrusctions on how to fix

Instructions are to be formulated so they specific to the task. The user may ignore the advice and continue the practice.

The PS is not supposed to solve problems. Only improve current progress. The PS can give advice for:
    * [Performance]
    * [Security]
    * [Hardware]

The PS is not a help system. It aims to help users make practice or software function optimally. The PS must AvoidObviousTemplates and DatalessTemplates.
