++ Word Processor

* word processor and spacing, should be more fluid in how you can drag paragraphs etc around on a page
 * read word processor file's text, render 3d image of it, use it as a map in a game


what you see is what you get should really apply to word processors to:
 - i want to copy this to somewhere else should be easy...highlight all that is wanted an paste elsewhere, included borders etc
  - indenting shouldn't be number based, perhaps on the left of print view i should see square lines to represent the fact that it is indented
  - split up a shape easily and fill contents
