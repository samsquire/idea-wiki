++ Application Migration

AM is the [Migration] of [Applications]. Migration is handled by ApplicationManagement. The contents of applications can be migrated. (see InstallPackages)

++Interfaces
The migration can be incurred in two ways:
    * from individual items, eg, right click a Component
    * a dedicated migration screen can be used which displays absolutely everything related to the application

++Example
    Instant Messenger
     an instant messenger would be capable of exporting Logs of chats and the application or the Preferences of users, address book etc

if using LDS, then easily export specific data: eg:
    - categorise exportable data
    
    - settings for using libraries, eg, settings for the web server, email etc
    - user interface and system settings, themes etc
