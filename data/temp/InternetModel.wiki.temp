    * Internet Society - leadership organization for policy, education, standards etc

    * Internet Architecture Board (IAB) is responsible for overseeing the development of the internet. This is possible due to the Internet Research and Internet Engineering Task Forces.
        * Research Groups (RGs) work under the IRTF, in the ISRG (internet steering research group)
        * Working Groups (WG) work under the IETF

The design of the internet is administered by various organisations. These are the
