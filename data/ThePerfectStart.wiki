++ The Perfect Start

TPS refers to how development of TheSystem will work. The stance is that quality can be maintained if it starts with high quality to begin with.

++Approaches

Concepts from Steve Maguire:
    * As Steve Maguire says in Writing Solid Code, the software should effectively be self-testing. Any error or problem should be obvious in the development environment.
    * The same algorithm will be written multiple times to ensure correctness against itself.
    * Netscape is said to be self-testing.
    * Algorithms should be written to make sure things work properly and without bugs.
