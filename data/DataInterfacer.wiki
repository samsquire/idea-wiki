++ Data Interfacer

The DI handles the route of data transmission for [Users], [Applications] and TheSystem.

    * When [Applications] are opened without input, the DI is invoked to request this information. AutoInterface creates an interface to ask for this efficiently.

    * DI can UseAnySource

    * The DI can issue data accesses for both [Internalisation] and [Externalisation] based tasks.
