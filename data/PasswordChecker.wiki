++ Password Checker

The PC detects whether a supplied password is easy to guess.
    * checks dictionary
    * character breakdown, human random number/machine random to determine how random it is

Another way to check for common passwords is to store a hash database of known passwords and ensure that the [Users] password does not match. This is because attackers are likely to lookup the stored hash of a password to determine the original.
