++ Totals

Totals are the sum of multiple values. Totals are to be represented on TheSystem as efficiently and effectively as possible.

++Architecture

Totals in TheSystem should have:
    * clear descriptions
    * [Encyclopedia] entries for indepth explanation of individual totals
    * BaseInteraction such as [Filtering] of particular totals and [Search] within a group

Conventional totals are useless. When presented by TheSystem in [Applications], [Encyclopedia] or [Reports], they should be as useful as possible.

    * Useless totals are ones that present only a number and the description. An example is SafetyReport service, Mcaffee Site Advisor:
file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/sam/My%20Documents/Pictures/Ideas/Bad%20UI/site_advisor_useless_totals.PNG

These totals should be explained and ordered for human understanding and viewing. A pie chart, a summary of the constituents of the total.


     * This is an important consideration for NativeImplementation]s of [SafetyReport]ers
    * Amazon Market place offers feedback totals for sellers in percentages.

     * This is an important consideration for the ProductSystem
