++ Standard Establishment

Standard Establishment means that there is an established source. SE are positive because they are of HighStandards. However, disadvantages to SE are:

    * creates assumptions on [Source] - see NoAssumptions
    * forced centralisation may make data brittle - see NoBrittleData
    * local or remote

[Multiples] are important with SE:

    * StandardMultiples
    * SE Source is changed to a different one SE (ImplicitImplementTheUnimplemented

SE contents tend to be physical. CrossReferential means that logical references may be made however.
AutomaticStandardEstablishment

++Examples
    * a folder at a specific location (NoBrittleData)
    * a folder and its contents - the 'data' folder on game engines
