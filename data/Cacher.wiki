++Clever Cache Control

* use last modified date AND dates on the page to determine when to update cache
  * if the page hasn't been modified for 3 years, it is unlikely to be updated within the next update cycle
  * use a probabiliy engine, take into consideration: when people sleep, eat, wake up, most productive hours etc, personal profile, location and other demographic to determine when page is most likely to be updated
  * a blog post that is added every 7am for example
 * using memory/hd to store cache

     * probability system, cache system learns from % how often the site is modified
