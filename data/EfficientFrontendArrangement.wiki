++ Efficient Frontend Arrangement

EFA means that the [Frontend] should always be arranged in the most efficient way possible.

++Requirements

    * The amount of whitespace should be limited to a set figure and amount.
    * DatalessTemplates should not cause WastedSpace
    * [Users] can begin using an interface easily. The EFA HelpTheUser
    * The rules used by EFA are easy for [Users] to grasp and are not difficult to understand.

++Implementation
This can be accomplished through:
    * Hiding elements of no importance
    * OptimalResizing
    * Resizing less useful elements so they do not impinge the user.
    * Ensuring elements are sized for them to be used efficiently
    * [Prioritizing] elements
    * Re-arranging elements according to priority
    * Collapsing or expanding groups.

HorizontalScrolling

++Examples
    * Windows Live Messenger shows empty groups of contacts even if they are all offline. This is a complete waste of space. Either the group could be completely hidden, moved to the bottom as they have a lower priority or automatically collapsed.
