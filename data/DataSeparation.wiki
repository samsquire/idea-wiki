++ Data Separation

DS refers to the physical separation of [Data] on UserInterfaces. Rules include:
    * Variable data is to be clearly separated by Static data.
    * Static data should not be embedded into variable data except for titling such as column headers and field names.
    * Documentation and Help is a prime suspect of DS, it doesn't need to be placed absolutely everywhere.
