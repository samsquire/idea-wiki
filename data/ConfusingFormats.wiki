++ Confusing Formats

Formats cause many problems in computing due to incompatibility of formats. This is because a file created in [Applications] may not open in others due to format differences.

This can be confusing to [Users] since the file is not regarded by format, only by what it contains. TheSystem should HelpTheUser and avoid focus on different formats.

++Solutions
Solutions to avoiding the format problem include:
    * ensure [Compatibility] between as many formats as possible to begin with. This is achieved through [Standardization] with SharedImplementation]s of formats.  [Conventional] systems are not so easy to co-operate with and require different solutions.
    * RepresentationConversion so that the right format is delivered
    * RepresentationGrouping by synchronizing multiple representations
