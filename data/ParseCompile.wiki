++ Parse Compile

PC is a DualEndpoint that supports NoEnumeration. PC means that parsing happens OnlyOnce. (NoParse). After this initial [Initialization], a ContinuousInitialization is used to maintain the PhysicalEndpoint of the parsed copy.

    * enumeration store - rather than processing data to filter it, actually store the sequence
     * it means more data is stored but at least it will be fast
     * to maintain consistency, whenever it is modified, the API modified this store aswell
     * example: Application Manufacturer and their Applications
      * as opposed to a relational database which has to be searched/read, this is PHYSICAL 

config compile - checking parts of memory frequently is inefficient
