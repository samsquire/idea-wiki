++ Insufficient Space

Insufficient space is a major problem in regard to [HardDrive]s and [Memory].

TheSystem should always be aware how much storage space is available in any volume at any time. I believe it could be stored in memory as a value that is always updated when files are written or deleted.

TheSystem should provide an early notice that the disk is practically full because the data in any open programmes is suddenly at risk because it has nowhere to go.

This needs to be represented by the system in some way. This could be represented through UserNotifications through some SystemTray dialogue that states: "There is now not enough storage space to store all open files." Upon clicking, the user is given a list of options. These could be deleting existing files, sending it in an email or uploading it online.
