++ Community Quality

CC is the quality of a community based on its individuals. This means:
    * trolls
    * flaming
    * spamming
    * personality clashes
    * arguments

++Implementations

Community accountability can be enforced by reducing anonymity through:
    * email activation
    * human checks
    * captchas
    * blocking free email providers

These checks can be combined:
    * domain blacklists
    * domain whitelists
    * certain domains need admin/self activation, others do not

Advanced user activation should be a default
 - some domains are 'safe listed' whereas are denied by default
