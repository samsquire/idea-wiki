++ Smart Cache

SC is a StandardEstablishment stack with a limited amount of space.
    * Items get pushed towards the bottom the more other items in the stack are used. Upon reaching the bottom, the item may be deleted.
    * SC is used before something is deleted and acts as an AccidentSafety net incase the user wishes to undo.
    * SC are used to create an artificial [Queue] so that information is obtained OnlyOnce.

SC is useful for:
    * [SharedImplementation]s
    * [MultipleVersions] [Applications]
    * permit temporary [Initialization] for UseAnySource

RelevancyHook]s of the RelevancySystem place or use [Links] items inside a SC when they are unwanted. Rather than deleting them, the SC guards against problems when they are required at a later date: OnlyOnce, AccidentSafety

For files, this means that saving a file will physically remain in the smart cache establishment by creating a hard link between the user's desired location and the smart cache.<![CDATA[</div>]]>
