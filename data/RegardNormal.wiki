++ Regard Normal

RN is where tasks that would appear to be out-of-the-ordinary or unconventional are integrated into TheSystem as a normal feature. This makes the feature appear less trivial and avoids:
    * InformationOverload 
    * FrenziedFeatures.

RN is possible due to SystemIntegration and no [Distance].

++Examples
    * Running [Servers] and hosting content
    * Creating AccessModes
    * [Games]
