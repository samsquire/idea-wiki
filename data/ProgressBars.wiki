++ Progress Bars

PB are a ProgressIndication that represent progress over time in a bar format. This can be in the form of RealRepresentation or a generic diagram.

++Architecture

[Conventional] PB are rarely proportional because the involved elements are rarely equal, such as [Files]. This makes them useless in indicating progress and give time guidelines. NativeImplementation]s of PB should:
    * indicate progress
    * to give a guideline how much longer the task will take
    * show how much work is completed in given time
In addition, some progress bars can also:
    * visually divide progress into stages, [Users] may be permitted to interact with this progress visually such as [ToolTips] and clicking on it
    * indicate the [Processing] on pieces, such as after detecting a result, movement of the result into progress

NativeImplementation]s of PB aim to be accurate and proportional.

Methodologies of improving PB usefulness include:
    * using exact scales rather than arbitary physical areas
    * using equal element sizes, such as 1megabyte in data rather than [Files]
    * using metaphors of the progress subject in question, filling up, running an indicator down a file
    * progress should be obvious with movement, colour changes or [Animation]

These representations can be combined into InterfacePanels for IndepthData.

For an [Installation]:
    * a scale can mark installation size in total file size, each step is 1MB of the total
    * movement of [Files] from one area to another
