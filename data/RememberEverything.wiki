++ Remember Everything

RE means that TheSystem should attempt to remember everything [Discarded] in a special area, DesignatedRefuseArea in order for:
    * smooth usability
    * [Undo], [ReversibilitySystem] and UndoWillUndo
    * return to what one was doing

++Implementation

TheSystem's ReversibilitySystem maintains a copy of anything [Discarded].
