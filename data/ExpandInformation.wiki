++ Expand Information

EI means TheSystem should be capable of expanding the amount of information stored. This is because storing the information initially permanently is infeasible because
    * it would take a lot of space
    * it may not even be used
This is why an expandable information architecture is required.
    * information should be obtainable on demand when it is needed.

Information is expanded using the ExpandSystem.
