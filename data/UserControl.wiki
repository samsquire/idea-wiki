++ User Control

UC is when [Users] understand and are in control of what is happening in [Applications] and TheSystem.

Maximum UC is implemented by:
    * User requests
    * ApplicationRules
    * MinimumRights
    * [Attention]
    * [UserNotifications] - the user is aware of what is happening

UC manifests itself with UserPower as the power users can influence on TheSystem and [Applications].
