++ Wrappers

++Neatness Wrappers
    TODO: make a better name or new concept 'information wrapper'
    * make things look tidier and appealing.
    * doesn't fix flaws with software
     * adjusts output/input based on external unrelated factors that are making things appear unappealing
     * fine tunes the inputs/outputs of a framework/engine etc 
    * example: justify text rather than aligning it left, center or right

++Security Wrappers
    * enforces security:
     * ensures only authorised people can access

++Safe Wrappers
    * Encapsulate unsafe functions making mistakes impossible. For example: shutdown, halt and reboot on Linux.
    * Redirect commands: if shutdown was done before terminate, shutdown will be delayed until terminate.

++Proposed
    * Compatibility Wrapper
    * speed wrappers (database readahead)
