++ No Capability Branding

NB means branding of [Capability] is avoided. [Applications] cannot enter OfficiallyAcceptedCertification if branding is used for capabilities. This is because brand names:
    * prevent brand names from becoming mainstream
    * confusing [Users]
    * make [Extensibility] difficult.
This does not effect [Applications] names. TheSystem will always UseGenericTerminology.
