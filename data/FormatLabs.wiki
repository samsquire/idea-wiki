    EULA Format
    Game Mod File
    Other Standards - some organisations claim to conform to standards
like RFCs, IEEE or ISOs. We can make a format that records a list of
standards and make icons for each of them. We can then offer CSS

icons, we can make the web more semantic. This can apply to products, to
processes or organisations as a whole, such as the PCI data security
standards. This is a bit like those 'hacker guard' icons you see on
