++ Make Recalling Easier

Recalling in the TheSystem should be easier than current modern architectures.

++Reasoning

Early computer architectures seemed to rely on recall based memory schemes.
    * files are stored under filenames in folder names which is referenced by a path.
    * command names

This forced people to organise files in well defined ways and become familiar with the data they maintain. Unfortunately, this takes a lot of effort and for most [Users] it is difficult to justify the effort.

In modern computing, this has brought forth a number of innovations that support these recall adverse users in favour of more direct recalling architectures.
    * Gmail uses labels rather than folders.
    * Ubiquitous search

These features are definitely helpful, allowing people to find files faster and easier. The perceived problems of these architectures include:
    * Presence simply masks the problems of the underlying data organisation.
    * Users do not actually know anything about organising files intelligently.
    * User friendly architectures shift intelligence from the human to the computer. This is a mistake, a computer is not as intelligent as a human.
    * The result is that people feed the computer generalised information about what they want but do not actually know where it is stored.
    * Search algorithms are slower than human knowledge.
    * Filesystems have not adapted to be efficient at organising and characterising data.
    * People have no care where the information is actually stored and the accuracy of its positioning in a system it becomes inconsistent and messy. Where any information can be retrieved by searching, there is little incentive to organise it efficiently.

TheSystem hopes to mitigate the problems with an intelligently designed recall based architecture that:
    * encourages adoption by users
    * improves consistency and accuracy 
    * is easy to use
    * enabled by default
    * innovative
    * avoid UnadoptedEstablishment of window's default music, pictures and documents folder
    *
