++ Any Mapping

AM means allows any content to map to any other content. Examples include:
    * directories
    * files
    * [Paths]
    * domains/subdomains
    * windows
    * processes
    * threads
    * [Entity]s

AM allows [Users] to create, use or access content seamlessly. AM can be used for SeamlessUsability and [Navigation].

The CreateMenu can be used to create new content accessed from ContextMenu]s that are placed where mappings are available. For example:
    * file(s) - the file
    * [TitleBar] - for the window
    * [Files] [Paths] - the file
    * the taskbar - the 

Once content is chosen, the application responsible for the type can be invoked in any of the following ways:
    * through [Tabs] of the application itself, UnchangingInterface and SingleInterface
    * by opening the application itself in a new window
    * by a sliding panel out of the side of the application

If a tab or sliding panel, saving is likely to be automatic to keep a SeamlessUsability. Saved content needs to be accessible from the target, this means TheSystem needs to know where to look or a reference. Multiple strategies can achieve this: 
    * saved in a location where the user requests and noted in the file's metadata and the application's configuration
    * StandardEstablishment of linked application content in UserArea that TheSystem consults when application is opened

Methods of accessing content include:
    * [Paneling] docked to the side of the window.
    * StandardRepresentations in InterfacePanels such as reviews, my blog post, wiki
