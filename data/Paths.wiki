++ Paths

Paths are the DataInterfacer's reference to data. Paths are also referential representations of data for the RepresentationSystem.
    * Paths are structured and follow [Standards].
    * [Mapping] usually occurs through AutoMapping
    * Paths are InteractiveText
    * ExactURL

Paths themselves have multiple [Representations]:
    * relative
    * [Absolute]
Copying and pasting the path of a file inside a web server folder could copy:
    * the web/ftp path of the file
    * the real path
