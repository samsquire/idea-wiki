++ Update Awareness

The UA describes a principle that TheSystem or [Applications] are aware of its updatedness. Aims of the principle are that:
    * minimize the frequency of checking for updates
    * minimize the time between the update release and the update check, [Security]
    * minimize annoying the user
    * reduce the uncertainty of an update
    * [Applications] have different [Update] frequencies
    * help DoNotScareTheUser
    * MakeNoiseAboutThingsThatMatter
    * avoid FalseEnd

++Implementation

The [Development] administrator responsible for development of the software may have established a consistent schedule for updates and realses. As a result, this information can be incorporated into the UpdateArchitecture so that a check corresponds with the schedule.

Using the [History] of previous updates, predict the most likely time of the next update based on the average time between previous updates.


use a time scheduled update
 - the software admin agrees that a new software release occur on a friday night at 6PM
 - the software will start checking/try to update every friday 6PM onwards
 -
