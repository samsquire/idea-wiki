++ Automatic Help Documentation

AHD means [Help] and [Documentation] materials should be generated ForFree, without extensive manual writing. This promotes NoManual. TheSystem intends to use AHD extensively as SystemPhilosophies through UpfrontConsideration and ParallelSimultaneousDevelopment.



Combine the Documentation and User Interface together.
    * Design a good user interface and have much of the documentation generated.
    * Write a "documentation" file, a condensed language which then generates a standard abiding uder interface.
    * Control language - outlines all methods of controlling the application and making it do what you want

++Implementation

TheSystem intends to use AHD to produce usable and useful materials. An unfortunate consequence of [Conventional] generation is LowAutonomicQuality. Proposed methods to mitigate this include:
    * Comprehensive metadata is recognised and stored during TheDevelopmentModusOperandi
    * Avoind the generation of full textual English because sentences are difficult to generate.
    * Instead, the interface should support the data structures. Search, context and CrossReferential.
    * The TaskArchitecture helps create [Help].
