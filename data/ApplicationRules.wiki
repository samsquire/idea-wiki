    * ReadonlyApplications

    JustUse
     * Applications can UseAnySource

    [Security]
     * Application can only write to the configuration and its output directories

    UserControl
     * impossible for applications themself to overwrite file associations
     * No folder permissions by default, applications must ask

    [Configuration]
     * Applications can modify InternalConfiguration but not ExternalConfiguration.
     * Only the user may.
     * StandardizedScreens are used if an application wishes to modify external configuration


* file system belongs entirely to the user?
* applications cannot write to filesystem
 * specialised partitions - should make access faster
 * config partition, OS partition,
 * record system as database and file system for files?
