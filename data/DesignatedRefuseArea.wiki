++ Designated Refuse Area
named by Joshua Lawrence Limbirons

The DRA is where [Discarded] items are stored for a [Restore] according to the ReversibilitySystem.

++Objects

    * SystemWindows
    * [Tabs]
    * applications
    * folder windows 
    * deleted objects from inside the application

++Implementation

When a change is about to be made, the DRA must store the discarded object. For efficiency, it must do this without wasting [Memory] or HardDrive space. One method is to OnlyStoreDifferences.

TheSystem will not necessarily physically move [Discarded] content to a StandardEstablishment. A better strategy is often to leave it where it is and mark it as deleted and add [Links] inside the DRA.

TheSystem may represent the DRA in a standard way. Potentialities include:
    * a standard toolbar that is above every other, such as the taskbar
    * a per-window DRA
    * both
