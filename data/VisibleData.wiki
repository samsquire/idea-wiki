++ Visible Data

VD means that whatever can be viewed is a potential [Source] for data. This is an example of UseAnySource. This includes UserInterfaces on behalf of TheSystem. VD is usually obtained with the [Clipboard].

Perhaps a mouse or keyboard shortcut that means 'grab any data you can see'. DynamicData is a particular subset of VD.
