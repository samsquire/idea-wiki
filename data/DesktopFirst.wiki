++ Desktop First

DF means that [Applications] are to be implemented and designed for the [Desktop] before WebApplications. 

DesktopApplications are HigherLevel implementations and support more features. DeriveNotReimplement means that the strong implementation of DesktopApplications can be derived to create WA.

WA can be derived from a DA but the reverse is impossible. Simply implementing as WebApplications cannot go any further and are [DeadEndImplementation]s.

Conventional systems are relying on WA frequently, making some kinds of desktop applications underused or even obsolete. TheSystem avoids this because:
    * WebApplications are an OverAbstraction
    * Destroys PersonalOwnership
    * Low SystemIntegration

DF can only work if:
    * DesktopApplications are as easy or easier to create than WebApplications
    * DA can run [Remote]ly

++Implementation

RepresentationSystem allows the more powerful desktop representation to be converted into a more simpler representation of WebApplications, using the principle of DeriveNotReimplement. To make DF an attractive platform, the following are necessary:
    * Simple but powerful [Developer]
    * RemoteSoftware
    * Consistently powerful desktop to web application conversions
