++ Saving Money

This is about my approach to saving money as much as possible.

    * Set up saving payments so I never 'see' it.
        * ISA stocks, standing order
    * Avoid everyday spending like coffee
    * Previous generation phone, television, entertainment devices, speakers
    * Cheap broadband and phone line, if possible.
        * Switch to pay as you go?
    * Avoiding service subscriptions like magazines, music subscriptions, web services, insurance
    * No gyms. Waste of money when you can walk everywhere.
    * No car. This is a contested point. Everyone wants me to drive but they are not economical. The way that society is going that cars and driving will become reserved for the elite. I save lots of money on not paying insurance. Although I have wasted plenty on lessons. I'm going to give up for now. Really don't enjoy driving. When society goes to shit, driving won't be economical.
