++ Development

Development is the production of [Applications]. TheSystem aims to keep development close to the operation of the system, see IntricateDevelopment.

    * Installed or running [Applications] allow their features to be accessible by other [Applications] through their [Backend]s. This is incredibly useful for development as it reinforces NoReimplementation and reusability for the ReusabilityArchitecture. This makes development faster. These are otherwise known as [SharedImplementation]s and there is a StandardEstablishment of them.

There are different aspects of development.
     * [Code]
     * DevelopmentStyle
     * DevelopmentInterfacers
     * [Marking]
     * [Refactoring]
     * CodeIdeas

The user can develop software with the [Developer].

++Procedures
The following procedures are used to make development more efficient:
    * Test Driven Development (TDD)
    * Code Coverage
    * GUI Testing
     * GUI pathing system, "route to do"
